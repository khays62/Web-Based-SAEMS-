This project aims to design and implement a web-based student and exam management system for Nuurul Al-Bayaan, a religious institute offering Islamic education through structured classes (up to 10 levels). Currently, the institute lacks a digital platform to efficiently manage its student data, class records, exam results, and academic structure. The proposed system will enable the administration and teachers to:

Add, view, edit, or delete student and teacher records.

Create and manage exams for different classes and subjects (e.g., Tafsir, Fiqh, Hadith).

Input students’ scores per subject, and automatically calculate averages and grades.

Generate printable PDF reports for individual or class performance.

Support term-based and final exams as per the institute’s calendar.

Access the system from desktop or mobile devices via a responsive web interface.

Ensure data security and usability for all user types: Admin, Teachers, and optionally Students.
